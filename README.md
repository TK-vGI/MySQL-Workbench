# MySQL Workbench

In this project, you'll gain hands-on experience building a data model for art information with MySQL Workbench that
conforms to the Third Normal Form. You'll learn how to translate this model into a functional database using forward
engineering. You'll also explore the potential of Generative AI to assist in model creation and leverage prompt
engineering to extract insights. This project equips you with the skills to become better at designing and querying
databases through exploring the world of art.

Ever wondered how Generative AI could transform your data journey? In this project, you will discover how Generative AI
and MySQL Workbench can help you become a more productive data modeler and analyst. You will combine these tools to
create a data model, turn this model into SQL code to initialize a database, and extract insights from the database with
Generative AI through prompt engineering.
