# Stage 3/5: Keywords used by Dutch artists
## Description
In the previous stages, you designed and populated the tables in the database. In this and subsequent stages,  
you will use Generative AI and MySQL Workbench for analytics.

This state focuses on Dutch artists and the keywords associated with their artworks. Subqueries play a pivotal role  
in this stage, allowing you to nest queries within other queries to perform complex data manipulations.  
Aggregate functions are also needed to complete this task.

You will require MySQL Workbench to run the SQL queries generated by the Generative AI.  
This is a good [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chezeWdTHbo) to learn how to use MySQL Workbench to query databases.

## Objectives
To complete this stage:
1. Answer the question: Find the average number of keywords associated with artworks created by Dutch artists
2. Prompt the conservational AI to answer this question
3. Study the AI response carefully to understand it
4. Run the response in MySQL Workbench to see the result
5. Prompt the AI to address whatever error messages or concerns you have
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until you get the correct answer
7. Copy the correct query from MySQL Workbench and paste in the solution space
